# Chapter 1 - Getting Started

## Introduction

This manual assumes that you are already familiar with units of measure,
and their basic usage. It also assumes that you have at least, on occasion,
performed a conversion by hand, be it the decimal point shifting involved in
convertic Metric lengths, or the slightly more involved matter of converting
between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Additionally it assumes you are familiar with the basic `dotnet` command-line
usage, C#, and basic algebra. All code examples are given in C#. And as appropriate
the underlying math pertinent to the conversion will be provided. One exception
is the [Mathematical Derivations For Selecting A Coefficient and Offset](../mathematical-derivations.md) 
document. It only discusses the mathematics involved in how certain constant 
conversions were arrived at. As such, you'll need familiarity the process of
creating equivalent functions.

Finally, [Chapter 4](../ch4/index.md) assumes you understand the fundamentals
of multi-threading, software performance, and IEEE754 double precision floating
point numbers. It details various considerations and limitations of this library
with respect to those concepts.
